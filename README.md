This is a simple version of 1D hydro code, with WENO 5th-order spatial discretization and Runge-Kutta 5-step 3rd-order time integration. A polytrope equation  equation of state and 1D relaxition solver for Poission equation is included. Currently a 1D Cartesian shock tube test is the default and only setting availabel, simple type ./run.sh the code should run and give out some result. Other models can be run with few modifications to be done.
